The idea of this project is to create an application that will allow small retail business or restaurants staff managing the products inventory easily while replacing the traditional pen and paper systems. I completed this project as part of my Mobile Software Development module in third year of college. It consists of a basic android application that allows keeping track of the current number of available items in an inventory system. 

The features range from creating users, suppliers, categories and products which are identified by a unique barcode number. Once a product is scanned, it becomes part of the inventory and can be set to an optimum number required by the business.The main goal of the application is to automatically notify the suppliers once a product drops below the required amount. This feature is still in development. However, the current application is a prototype of the future inventory management system.
